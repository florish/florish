==============

**In Holacracy and other self-management paradigms, purpose is seen as a core concept. But what makes purpose so vital for self-managing organizations, and why should you care?**

## A thought experiment

Let's assume you are the managing director of a software company with three departments: Sales, Engineering, and Recruitment.

One day, you get contrasting reports from two of your departments. Sales figures are better than ever before. Engineering, however, reports high work loads and not being able to deliver software on time.

As a strategic direction, you decide engineering capacity should be increased. You ask the Recruitment department to take up a project to hire two new software engineers. As a first action, they should write up a job description and send it to you for final approval.

## Same situation, different approach

Now, let's do this same experiment for a self-managing organization running on Holacracy. I assume familiarity with Holacracy's basic concepts. Otherwise, consider watching [this introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUHfVoQUj54) to get a quick overview.

For the context of this article, we'll focus on the concept of _Lead Link_. In the Holacracy operating system, there is no such thing as a "managing director" or other "manager" or "leader" job titles. Instead, work is divided over circles and roles. Each circle has a purpose and a special role called Lead Link. One of the Lead Link's responsibilities is to ensure the circle is working towards its purpose.

The top-level circle in an organization is called the _Anchor Circle_. The purpose of that circle is also the organization's overall purpose. The Lead Link of the Anchor Circle is accountable for discovering and expressing this purpose.

Let's apply this to our software development company. Instead of being managing director, you now fill the Lead Link role for the company's Anchor Circle. You can still get the same reports: Sales is doing great, Engineering is struggling. Based on this information, you can also still make the same strategic decision to focus on increasing engineering capacity.

So far so good. But what's different then?

As managing director, you could manage everything from strategy down to projects and actions. As a Lead Link, your authority stops after the strategic level. In a self-managing organization, you can no longer _tell_ your Recruitment department (which would technically be called a Recruitment circle in Holacracy terms) to take up a project to hire two new engineers. You can _ask_, but ultimately the person responsible for recruitment is the one deciding if and when the project is taken up.

## The concept of purpose

At first, this might feel odd. Why, from a managing director point of view, would you voluntarily choose to give up control over which projects have priority and how they are being executed? To answer this question, we'll first take a closer look at the concept of purpose.

Holacracy [defines purpose as follows](http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art523):

> (...) the deepest creative potential [an organization] can sustainably express in the world, given all of the constraints acting upon it and everything available to it.

As said earlier, as a company's top-most Lead Link, you are accountable for discovering and expressing the organization's purpose. This means you have a duty to ask this question: what is the deepest creative potential our organization can express in the world? Or put differently: what is the reason our organization exists?

Make no mistake: these are tough questions to answer! Holacracy acknowledges this, and also assumes purpose not to be defined once and never changed, but as evolutionary. Over time, given new information, an organization's purpose will change, and as Lead Link, you may (and should) update the purpose when needed.

## Sizing it up

Time to go back to our thought experiment. While we never mentioned anything about purpose, we did mention three other concepts: strategy, project and action. Each of these can be seen as part of another. Arranged from small to large, this gives us the following sequence:

* The **action** "write draft job advertisement for approval" _is part of_
* **project** "two new software engineers hired", _which helps execute_
* **strategy** "increase engineering capacity".

Where would **purpose** fit in this sequence? Right after strategy. Any strategic focus you set is in service of better fulfilling the organization's purpose, just as a project helps execute a strategy and an action helps finish a project. In a way, purpose explains why strategies, projects and actions exist.

## Shared focus

Well, you say, this is all cleverly thought out, but why bother with all this purpose? Why not just stick with delegating projects and actions to people?

While it is beyond the scope of this article to go into all of the reasons behind transitioning to Holacracy and self-management in general, I do like to point out two things in particular: time and brainpower.

It is all fine as a managing director to come up with the projects and actions for your employees to execute, but only up to a point. Once the organization grows larger, you won't have time to do this all as a single person (or you'd have to skip sleeping). This is traditionally the point where management layers enter the arena.

Apart from time constraints, there's a brainpower issue. While you are probably a very intelligent managing director, the ideas you come up with are ultimately limited by, well, what _you_ can come up with. There is a good chance someone else out there in the organization has a better idea you are missing out on.

Holacracy attempts to avoid these problems by enabling _everyone_ in the organization to make strategic decisions about which projects and actions to take up next. This is not assumed to just work magically. For this decision making process to be effective, a shared focus is needed. Purpose is seen as the foundation for this. The better your organization's purpose is being expressed, the better it serves as a beacon for day-to-day decisions about what to do next.
