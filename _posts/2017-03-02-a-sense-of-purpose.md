==============

**How two seeminglingly unrelated experiences helped discover a personal purpose.**

## At work

Where I work, one of my responsibilities is to periodically determine a strategic focus for the department I lead.

Shortly after communicating a new strategy, our company owner and founder came to me. He asked me to change part of the strategy into something else. I refused, not seeing the added value. He pressed, seeing the requested change as absolutely necessary. I got angry and frustrated, he got angry and frustrated.

After cooling down somewhat, we came to a point of agreeing to disagree.

## At home

Coming home that night, I greeted my wife and kids and noticed toys lying around all over the living room. So I said to my kids (2 and 4 years old):

"Clean up the room, will you? Dinner is almost ready and it's a mess here."

No response. I tried a different approach:

"Listen, dinner is almost ready. Mom and I are going to have dinner, and you will only get dinner after all of these toys have been moved into the boxes where they belong."

Well, that _did_ trigger a response. Kicking, screaming, shouting, protesting, all of it. But my wife and I persisted, and in the end, the toys were stowed away and our kids were having dinner at the table.

My wife and I weren't happy with this, though. Effective as it may be sometimes, as a rule, we try not to threaten with one thing to get another thing done from our kids.

## Autonomy and respect

Looking back at these situations, two words keep coming backing into my mind: autonomy and respect.

At work, I assumed autonomy on strategic decisions for the department I was responsible for. And my boss assumed autonomy on strategic decisions for the company he owned. We clashed when we both _demanded_ respect for our ideas and forgot to _show_ respect for each other's point of view.

At home, I wanted autonomy on how our home was organized. And I demanded respect from my kids by refusing them dinner until they did what I wanted. By doing this, however, I forgot to respect the autonomy my kids might want in when and how to clean up the room.

In both situations I wanted autonomy. On sensing I could not have it, I tried to demand it by disrespecting someone else's autonomy. At work, this did not help me. At home, it did, but I felt bad.

How to avoid this pattern of demand and disrespect? To truly receive respect for my own autonomy, I need to truly respect other people's autonomy. This means taking an effort to understand other people's needs, and to communicate my own needs and values as respectfully as I can.

So: autonomy and respect, simple as that. Only thing left is to master the art of _not_ demanding it :)
