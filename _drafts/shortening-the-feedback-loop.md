title: Shortening the feedback loop
---

{{page.title}}
==============

On a project retrospective, we found that the best work we delivered had short feedback loops during the development process. Also, we were least satisfied with work that took a long and lonely road before being reviewed by another person. How can we ensure feedback is at the core of our development process?

A while ago, when talking about software development, a [colleague](http://www.arjanvandergaag.nl) semi-jokingly said:

> Feedback is the currency of software development

We laughed at the statement's cheesiness, and got back to work.

... something on how this turned out to be pretty much our retrospective conclusion ...

## How we manage projects

We use [Trello](https://trello.com) for project management. Boards are projects, cards are features. Progress is tracked by moving cards between lists.

<<BOARD PICTURE>>

The idea is to keep a backlog in Up Next with features prepared and ready for development. As a developer, simply pick the top card from Up Next, put your name on it and move it to Doing.

## Start together

As simple as this sounds, in practice, starting feature development on your own means missing an opportunity for discussion. We found the "start together" part to be an essential early feedback mechanism. An hour of talking often results in improved ideas over what had been thought out before.

## Keep meeting

Starting together is also useful in determining next step(s) to take. Make these steps small and immediately plan a next meeting to discuss progress. Ideally, this next meeting should be held after no more than a couple of hours work (e.g. a single morning or afternoon).

In the next meeting, make sure to again define next steps and when to discuss progress. Keep iterating until the work is done and ready to move to the next list on the Trello board.

## Move out extra work

* Create new cards for non-essential functionality
* Avoid putting multiple cards into a single pull request

## Give feedback priority

* Giving feedback on someone else's feature is more important than working on your own stuff
* Don't forget: giving good feedback takes time, allow this time to be spent
